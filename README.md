# Improvements to Original Repository

This is a fork of [flying-focus](https://github.com/NV/flying-focus/). In the original repository, the focus disappears after 150ms. In this fork, it will remain visible when navigating using tab. Also, this fork has a package.json, separate src files for js and scss.

```bash
$ npm install @chase439/flying-focus
```

All other files that aren't necessary for the standalone version were removed.

# [Focus Transition](http://n12v.com/focus-transition/)

Flying Focus is a UI concept. It adds a transition to the focus outline when you tab around inputs, buttons, and links.
